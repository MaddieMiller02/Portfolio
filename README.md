# Portfolio
Personal portfolio, made up primarily of school assignment and personal projects. This README contains information about running each project, and the context behind their creation.

Snake
- Created for my Data Structures and Algorithms course in Python. Designed to teach the use of linked lists.
- Requires the use of the dudraw extention, a proprietary extension created for the University of Denver's computer science program, based on preexisting Python draw extentions. Documentation can be found here: https://git.cs.du.edu/super-serious-software/dudraw
- Creates a basic version of the game Snake, utilizing a linked list data structure. Use "WASD" to control the snake.

Malicious Hangman
- Created for my Data Structures and Algorithms course in Python. Designed to teach the use of data sets.
- Malicious Hangman is played in the terminal. It's similar to normal hangman, with the computer randomly selecting a word from a preexisting dictionary, also included. However, in this version of the game, every time a player guesses a letter, the game actively eliminates all words containing that letter from the possible list of answers. It doesn't actually select an "answer" until it's impossible for the game to find a word in the remaining possible answers that doesn't contain the letter the player guessed.
